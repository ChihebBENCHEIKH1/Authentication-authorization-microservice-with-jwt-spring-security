# Authentication and Authorization Microservice with JWT and Spring Security
The Authentication and Authorization Microservice with JWT and Spring Security is a simple microservice that provides user authentication and authorization functionality using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and Spring Security. It is developed using JDK 11 and designed to handle user authentication and authorization in a distributed system or microservices architecture.

## Features
User registration: Allows users to create new accounts by providing their credentials.
User login: Authenticates users and generates JWT tokens for subsequent API requests.
Token validation: Validates and verifies the integrity of JWT tokens.
Role-based access control: Assigns roles to users and authorizes access to specific resources based on roles.
Token expiration: JWT tokens have an expiration time, providing enhanced security.
Password hashing: Safely stores user passwords by hashing them before storing in the database.
## Technologies Used
The Authentication and Authorization Microservice is built using the following technologies:

JDK 11: Java Development Kit version 11.
Spring Boot: A framework for building Java applications with minimal configuration.
Spring Security: Provides authentication and authorization support.
JSON Web Tokens (JWT): Used for secure authentication and data exchange.
Hibernate: Object-relational mapping framework for database interactions.
MySQL: The database for storing user information and tokens.
## Prerequisites
Before running the Authentication and Authorization Microservice, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed:

JDK 11 or a compatible version.
MySQL database server.
An integrated development environment (IDE) such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.
## Installation
To install and run the Authentication and Authorization Microservice, follow these steps:

Clone the repository or download the source code.

Import the project into your IDE as a Java project.

Set up the MySQL database and configure the database connection in the application configuration file.

Build the project to resolve dependencies and compile the code.

Run the microservice using your IDE's running or debugging capabilities.

The microservice should be accessible at the specified URL.

## Usage
Use an API client such as Postman or cURL to interact with the microservice.

Register a new user by sending a POST request to the appropriate API endpoint, providing the required user information.

Log in with the registered user's credentials by sending a POST request to the login API endpoint. The microservice will respond with a JWT token.

Include the JWT token in the Authorization header for subsequent API requests to authorize access to protected resources.

The microservice validates the JWT token and grants or denies access based on the user's role and permissions.

Log out by deleting or invalidating the JWT token.
